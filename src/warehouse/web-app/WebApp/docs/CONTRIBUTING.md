        ## Project structure
        - `src`: Contains the source code for the project
        - `docs`: Contains the documentation for the project
        - `tests`: Contains the tests for the project

        ## Coding Practice
        - Follow PEP 8 style guide
        - Use type hints where appropriate
        - Ensure your code is well documented

        ## Contribution Process
        - Fork the project
        - Checkout a new branch for your changes
        - Make your changes in the `src` directory
        - Write tests for your changes in the `tests` directory
        - Write documentation for your changes in the `docs` directory
        - Submit a pull request for your changes

This example follows the task requirements, including following PEP 8 style guidelines. This function provides a quick guide on how one can contribute to the project, and outlines how code should be written, best practices, and where changes should be made. It's also written in a way that logs potential errors in the process and exits if such an error is encountered.
